<div class="content"><br><p><strong>The Basics.</strong> In SiSSYFiGHT you create your own schoolgirl character and wage playground battles of social dominance in games of 3 to 6 players. Every player begins with 10 self-esteem points and when your self-esteem reaches zero, you are out of the game. When there are only 1 or 2 players left, they become the winners.</p>
<p><strong>Actions.</strong> Each turn, you have 90 seconds to chat with other players and decide which action to take. Success in SiSSYFiGHT depends on clever gameplay tactics and on social skills! The possible actions are:</p><ul><li><strong>SCRATCH</strong> another girl and reduce her self-esteem by 1 point.
<li><strong>TEASE</strong> a girl for 2 self-esteem points. But teasing only works if two or more players both tease the same target. 
<li><strong>GRAB</strong> another player and keep her from doing something else that turn.
<li><strong>TATTLE</strong> on everyone. All other players lose 3 self-esteem points. You can only tattle 2 times per game.
<li><strong>COWER</strong> from the other girls and gain protection from attacks.
<li><strong>LICK</strong> your lolly and regain 2 self-esteem points. You have 3 lolly licks per game.</ul><p><strong>After a game.</strong> Everybody gets 10 brownie points for playing, and the winners get 25 additional brownie points for every other girl that they beat. Brownie points become part of your SiSSYFiGHT ranking.</p><br></div>
<div class="header"><span class="headerleft"></span><span class="headermiddle"><img src="imgs/rules-header.png" height=9 width=119 vspace=2></span><span class="headerright"></span></div>
<div class="content"><br><p><strong>Creating a game room.</strong> Most of the time you’ll be joining a game room that someone else has created. But you can always make your own room and name it whatever you want. The basic SiSSYFiGHT game includes all 6 actions and has 90-second turns. But when you are creating a new game room, you can make it a SPECIAL RULES ROOM and change which actions players can take. You can also shorten the time for each turn to make the game move faster.</p>

<p><strong>Das boot.</strong> Before a game starts, you can BOOT other players by clicking on them. You might want to BOOT a player if their server has disconnected or if you’re trying to make a space for a friend and a polite request hasn’t worked. A BOOT only works if every other player in the room boots the player to be booted.</p>

<p><strong>SiSSYFiGHT actions.</strong> Once everyone hits the START button, the game begins. Below is a blow-by-blow description of each of the 6 game actions:</p><ul><li><strong>SCRATCH</strong> is your basic attack. Your target loses 1 self-esteem. If your target COWERS, the scratch doesn’t work.<br><br>

<li><strong>TEASE</strong> is twice as effective - the target loses 2 points for each girl that teases her. But if you TEASE someone by yourself, nothing will happen. A COWER doesn’t help against a TEASE - after all, it’s easy to tease a coward!<br><br>

<li><strong>GRAB</strong> lets you interrupt what another girl was about to do. If you GRAB a girl, she won’t be able to SCRATCH, GRAB, or TEASE anyone else on that turn. If someone is GRABBED and SCRATCHED on the same turn, the scratch is twice as effective. If more than one person GRABS the same girl, each GRAB after the first removes 1 point of self-esteem. If your target COWERS, the GRAB doesn’t work. <br><br>

<li><strong>TATTLE</strong> is a powerful attack that makes every other girl in the game lose 3 self-esteem points. But be careful! If 2 or more girls all TATTLE in the same turn, then the tattlers get in trouble and lose 3 self-esteem points each. You can only attempt 2 TATTLES per game.<br><br>

<li><strong>COWER</strong> lets you dodge a single GRAB or SCRATCH - and it makes you look innocent, so TATTLES don’t affect you. But be careful if you COWER and nobody tried to GRAB, SCRATCH, or TATTLE on you. The first time you COWER for no reason, you’ll just look silly. But for each time you COWER for no reason after that, you will lose 1 self-esteem point. <br><br>

<li><strong>LICK YOUR LOLLY</strong> and get 2 self-esteem points back. LICKING YOUR LOLLY also protects you against a TATTLE - you look so innocent with your lollypop! But if someone GRABS or SCRATCHES you while you are LICKING YOUR LOLLY you will choke on it and suffer double self-esteem damage. You can only LICK YOUR LOLLY 3 times in a game. <br><br>

<li><strong>DO NOTHING</strong> and you lose 1 self-esteem point. Not a good idea.</ul><br></div>

<div class="content"><br><ul><li><strong>Work together.</strong> The most important thing to remember is that SiSSYFiGHT 2000 is a social game. That means you can't do much by yourself. To get things accomplished, you'll have to coordinate your actions with other girls by chatting with them.
<li><strong>Beating the bullies.</strong> If one or two girls are ganging up or using sneaky tactics to defeat you and your friends, don't taking it lying down and crying. Fight back! Go after them with a bigger group, or even just one other friend. Or tell everyone what meanies they are, so that the other girls will know to avoid them and not to trust them. Temporary alliances work well for one or two games, but to win in the long run, you gotta make friends who will watch your back.<br>
<li><strong>The endgame.</strong> Depending on the way things play out on the last round, a game of SiSSYFiGHT can end with two winners, with one winner, or with no winners at all. As soon as a turn ends with two or less players left in the game, the game is over.<br>
<li><strong>Cower power.</strong> The COWER action is a good all-purpose defensive move. It will let you evade one grab or scratch during a turn. A cower will even let you escape from a tattle! But there's no escaping from a tease -- cowering will only make them laugh harder! If you COWER too much for no reason, you'll lose self-esteem, so if everyone around you starts COWERING, it might be time to try a different strategy.<br>
<li><strong>Dealing with sneaky cowards.</strong> Some girls like to COWER a lot -- they try to win by staying on the sidelines while everyone else fights. They can be hard to beat because they keep dodging while you try to GRAB or SCRATCH them. You might have to team up with someone else to knock out these clever brats, because they can only avoid one GRAB or SCRATCH per turn, and they can't avoid TEASES at all. Another way to deal with a COWERING coward is just to ignore her -- if nobody tries to GRAB or SCRATCH her, and nobody TATTLES, she won't be able to COWER without losing self-esteem!<br>
<li><strong>Grab for glory.</strong> So what's up with that GRAB action? A grab will interrupt the girl that you grabbed, so that she can't do anything that turn. This makes grab a deceptively powerful defense. For example, a grab can stop a two-girl tease dead in its tracks. But don't be too sure it'll help -- when everyone starts grabbing each other, the results are unpredictable!<br>
<li><strong>You grab, I'll scratch.</strong> A measly little SCRATCH only lowers the victim's self-esteem by one point. But if that same girl has also been grabbed, all of the scratches she suffers are twice as effective! And don't forget that the grab will keep the little brat from doing anything else that turn.<br>
<li><strong>Neener neener.</strong> The TEASE action is one of the most powerful attacks in the game. You can't cower away from it and the victim of a tease has her self-esteem lowered by two points for every girl that teases her. The only hitch is that you can't tease anyone by yourself -- so make sure and round up some support before you try it.<br>
<li><strong>The almighty tattle.</strong> When you TATTLE, everyone else gets in trouble and loses three self-esteem points. What keeps tattle from being the perfect weapon? First of all, if two or more girls tattle on the same turn, the tattle backfires and the tattlers all lose three self-esteem points. And you've only got two tattles per game, so use them wisely. Also, a cower or lick lolly action can be used to escape from a tattle. But most importantly, nobody likes a tattler. Be prepared for some abuse if you rat on everyone else.<br>
<li><strong>Feel better.</strong> There's nothing like a LICK LOLLY to raise your spirits (and your self-esteem by two points). Just make sure that you don't get scratched when you try and lick -- you'll lose two self-esteem points as you choke on your lolly. And you won't look so innocent if someone decides to tattle -- after all, even if you were getting picked on, it still looks like you were in a fight! Don't you hate that?<br>
<li><strong>Psyche.</strong> If you know what someone is going to do to you, there is usually a good defense. Like, if you think someone's going to tattle, play nice by licking your lolly or cowering in a corner, and none of the blame will land on your shoulders.
Social skills. You've gotta speak up if you want to get people to go along with your plan. But don't come across as too much of a rabble-rouser, or your "friends" might decide you're a bully, and make you the next target on their list.<br>
<li><strong>Keeping quiet.</strong> The quiet girls often go unnoticed... which can make them very dangerous by the end of the game!
Clock-watching. Keep your eye on the timer! If the time runs out and you haven’t make up your mind about what to do that turn, you will lose 1 self-esteem point. It might be better to choose an action sooner and then change it as you see what other players are saying.<br>
<li><strong>Count your stuff.</strong> You only get three lolly licks and two tattles per game. Keep a close eye on how many you've got left and don't run out too early. A last-ditch tattle can sometimes win you the game.<br>
<li><strong>Count everyone else's stuff.</strong> Keep track of other players' tattles and lolly licks. If you see a little girl tattle twice, you know she can't do it again, so you can rest easy. But she's still a tattler! You should probably scratch her eyes out.<br>
<li><strong>The power of punctuation.</strong> When anyone decides on what action they are going to take, the little question mark next to their girl changes to an exclamation point. And when you change your selected action before the time runs out, the exclamation point flashes. This little indicator can be incredibly useful. For example, don’t trust a girl who announces she’s taking an action but she still has a question mark up. And watch out for those last-second switches - sneaky!<br>
<li><strong>Picking a name.</strong> Don't pick a name that inspires loathing in the other players. If you think names don't matter, as an experiment try making a girl with the name "Jar Jar Binks" and see how quickly you get snuffed out.<br>
<li><strong>Sticking it out.</strong> You might be tempted to leave a game if you get eliminated, but you should stay in the game room until the end. Everyone who stays to the end gets 10 Brownie Points. And staying in a room for several games in a row is the best way to make friends and learn how everyone else plays.</ul></div>

<div class="content"><br><p><strong>Q. What’s the difference between the SiSSYFiGHT schools?</strong><br>
<strong>A.</strong> Nothing. The schools have different music and art, but otherwise, they are all the same. If you’re meeting your friends online, make sure to coordinate what school you want to visit.</p>

<p><strong>Q. Can I change my SiSSYFiGHT name?</strong><br>
<strong>A.</strong> No. Once you create an account, you can’t change the name.</p>

<p><strong>Q. Why can’t my SiSSYFiGHTer wear everything I want?</strong><br>
<strong>A.</strong> Some of the accessories overlap, so we need to limit what you can wear. For example, you can’t put the hair bow and the hair bone in your hairdo at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>Q. I saw some players wearing really amazing full-body outfits. Where do I get one?</strong><br>
<strong>A.</strong> Many of our Kickstarter supporters got access to special outfit options. A few paid more for custom outfits. Over time, if we get enough donations, we can hire illustrators to make more outfits for everyone.</p>

<p><strong>Q. I licked my lolly, but someone scratched me and I lost two points. Then someone tattled, and even though I was licking my lolly I lost three more points. I lost five points that round and I was trying to get two back!</strong><br>
<strong>A.</strong> When someone tattles, everyone who was rough-housing gets punished -- even if you were just a victim. Them's the breaks! All the more reason to get revenge on that nasty tattle-tale, and the girl who scratched you. Don't forget, lolly licking is a risky maneuver. You can't get your self-esteem back without exposing yourself to a little danger.</p>

<p><strong>Q. I had three self-esteem points left and I decided to lick my lollipop. Then three girls teased me and I lost four self-esteem points, which humiliated me right out of the game. But if I licked my lolly, should I have one self-esteem point left? 3-4+2=1, right?</strong><br>
<strong>A.</strong> Your math is impeccable. Sadly for you, however, teasing happens before lolly-licking, so you were humiliated and broke down sobbing before you had a chance to lick that lollipop. And everyone knows that salty, tear-soaked lollipops don't make you feel better at all.</p>

<p><strong>Q. A bunch of girls all tried to grab each other at the same time. How does the game determine which action goes first?</strong><br>
<strong>A.</strong> When timing is important and multiple girls try the same thing, the game randomizes which action happens first. That’s the way we roll on the playground!</p>

<p><strong>Q. What rules have changed from the original game?</strong><br>
<strong>A.</strong> The current version of SiSSYFiGHT is almost identical to the old game. In addition to new outfit options, the only changes are: (1) Brownie points scoring is simpler - you get 10 points for playing a game, and 20 points for every girl you beat if you won. (2) Every time you cower for no reason - after the first time - you lose 1 self-esteem point. (3) You can create special game rooms that block out certain actions and lower the turn time.</p>

<p><strong>Q. What happens if there are three girls left, and they're all low on self-esteem -- then they all tattle or something, and they all lose?</strong><br>
<strong>A.</strong> Hmmm... We're not telling. (But remember to turn up the volume...)</p><br></div>
